# Efficient Portfolio Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Python-based tool to identify the efficient portfolio for individuals based on their risk tolerance and expected returns. The ultimate goal is to incorporate extra-financial elements such as sector preferences (e.g., avoiding tobacco-related sectors), ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, and a focus on French companies.

## Project Scope

- **Portfolio Optimization**: Utilize Python to calculate and recommend efficient portfolios tailored to individual risk profiles and return expectations.
- **Extra-Financial Considerations**: Integrate non-financial factors into the portfolio selection process, including ESG scores and sector preferences.
- **French Market Focus**: Prioritize investments in French companies to support local economic growth.

## Collaborators

This project is a collaborative effort between two Master's students specializing in Economics and Finance.

## Features

- **Risk-Return Analysis**: Assess and optimize portfolios based on risk and return metrics.
- **ESG Integration**: Incorporate ESG criteria into the investment decision-making process.
- **Sector Preferences**: Allow users to exclude specific sectors based on personal preferences.
- **French Market Emphasis**: Focus on investments within the French market.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand the tool to include more granular ESG data.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easier interaction.
- Incorporate real-time market data for dynamic portfolio adjustments.
